# Set MUTTALIAS_FILES below to list of files in MUTT_DIRECTORY that
# contain mutt aliases. File names without leading slash will have
# $MUTT_DIRECTORY (defaults to $HOME/.mutt or $HOME, if ~/.mutt does
# not exist) prepended before the file name. Absolute file names
# (beginning with /) will be taken direct.

# - m_ldap  query an LDAP server.
#
# This module queries an LDAP server using the Net::LDAP Perl modules
# from CPAN. It can be configured using an external resource file. You
# can explicity define a LDAP query in this file or you can use one or
# more of the predefined queries from the %ldap_server_db in this
# file. For this you have to define the selected enties as a space
# separated list in the the variable LDAP_NICKS.
#
#LDAP_NICKS="debian bigfoot"


# - m_abook query the abook(1) programm
#
# if you have more than one abook addressbook, use the ABOOK_FILES
# variable. It contains a space separated list of all your files. 
# Default is $HOME/.abook/addressbook $HOME/.abook.addressbook
# ABOOK_FILES="$HOME/.abook/friends $HOME/.abook/work"


# Do you want the output to be sorted?
# If you set this to "false" or "no", lbdbq won't sort the addresses
# but returns them in reverse order (which means that the most recent
# address in m_inmail database is first).
# If you set this to "name", lbdbq sorts the output by real name.
# If you set this to "comment", lbdbq sorts the output by comment (column 3).
# If you set this to "reverse_comment", lbdbq sorts the output by comment 
#                                       but with reverse order (column 3).
# If you set this to "address", lbdbq sorts the output by addresses
# (that's the default).

# Do you want to see duplicate mail addresses (with multiple real
# names or different comment fields)?  Default is "no".
